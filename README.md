NOTICE, if you recieve error messages when running PIP in your terminal console, reinstall python for your system and MAKE SURE "Environmental variables" is ticked and your system will then find python and pip (although flask may need a reinstall)

pip install flask
pip install flask_bootstrap
pip pinstall flask_sqlalchemy
pip install flask_login
pip install flask_wtf
