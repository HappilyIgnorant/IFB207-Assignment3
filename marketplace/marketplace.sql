I discovered the quality of this paint during a USA visit and was taken aback by the incredible effects and finish that can be achieved with this paint. It opened the door to my experimentation with fluid acrylic as Pebeo Moonlight paint is extremely difficult to access in Australia. So far I could only create very few pieces with this paint material, making Celebration very special.
I choose the name ‘Celebration’ as it is a celebration of this new experiment and the picture itself is covered in many small fireworks, marking it’s celebration and it is ready to brighten up your home too.
